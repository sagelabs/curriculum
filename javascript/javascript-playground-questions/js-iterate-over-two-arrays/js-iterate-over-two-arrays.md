# Iterate Over two Arrays

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that:
> - **iterates over two arrays simultaneously**
> - **outputs a value from each array as a pair**

Example arrays:

```javascript
let names = ['Stefan', 'Michael', 'Rebekah', "Natasha"];
let lastNames = ['Stojanovic', 'Stevens', 'Mikaelson', "Romanoff"];
```

Example output:
```plain-text
Stefan Stojanovic
Michael Stevens
....
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...of`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create the arrays and use a loop to cycle through them. 

> Use the same index to track the second array as well.
