# Miles to Kilometres Converter

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that:
> - **converts miles to kilometers**
> - **outputs a message along with the result**

It's up to you to choose which operation to use and what the message will be.

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /`)
- A kilometer is equal to `0.621371` miles
- A mile is equal to `1.60934` kilometers

As a bonus, see how you would round the result up to 2 decimal places.

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use one variable to hold the number of miles, another to hold the conversion factor, and a third one to hold the result.

Example input / output:
```plain-text
// Input
3 miles

// Output
