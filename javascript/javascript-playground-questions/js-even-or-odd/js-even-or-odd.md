## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a program that:
> - **takes a number as input**
> - **checks if it is even or odd**
> - **outputs a message for both cases** 

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`if (age > 30) ...`)
- arithmetic operators (`+, -, %, ...`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

> 💡 The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit. The implementation is up to you.

> 🤓 Happy learning! Open the playground and start coding!
