## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that:
> - **takes a string as input**
> - **reverses it** 
> - **outputs it to the console**

Example:
```javascript
// Input
"Desserts"

// Output
"stresseD"
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`for...of`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use one variable for the normal string and another for the reversed.

Reverse them using a loop.
