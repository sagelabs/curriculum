# Squared Object Keys

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create an object:
> - **its keys should go from 1 to 10 (bounds included)**
> - **the value corresponding to each key should equal the square value of the key**

Example solution:
```javascript
{
  1: 1, 
  2: 4, 
  3: 9, 
  4: 16, 
  5: 25, 
  6: 36, 
  7: 49, 
  8: 64, 
  9: 81, 
  10: 100
}
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- flow control (`for...of`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by creating an empty object.

Then using a loop, go through every element in the range of `1` to `11`.

Assign each value the squared value of the key.
