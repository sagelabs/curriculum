# Harmonic Series

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a function that will:
> - **sum up the first 15 terms of the harmonic series**
> - **round them to 5 decimal places**

> The harmonic series is the divergent infinite series that looks like this:

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 25`)
- flow control (`for...of`)
- function declaration (`function Something(){}`)
- methods & functions (`toFixed`, `Math.round()`,...)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Start by defining a function with a name of your choosing. The function should take a number as input.

> The number will be the number of terms of the divergent series.

The function should use a loop to cycle through, calculate the series, and return the result.

Finally, outside the function, round and return the result up to 5 decimal places.
