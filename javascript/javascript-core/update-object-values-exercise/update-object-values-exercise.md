    // 👋 Welcome to the JavaScript coding playground.
    // Use this object:

    let person = {
      name: "Albert Einstein",
      profession: "Theoretical physicist",
      languages: ["Italian", "English"]
      equation: "c^2 = a^2 + b^2"
      quote: "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving."
    };
    
    // Type your code here:

# Update Object Values

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your tasks are to:
- **add the missing `"German"` language**
- **replace the wrong `equation` with the correct one; `"e = mc^2"`**
- **add a new key called `"nobelRecipient"` with the value `true`**
- **delete the `quote`**
- **log the new `person` object to the console**

Use this `object`:
```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Albert Einstein",
  profession: "Theoretical physicist",
  languages: ["Italian", "English"]
  equation: "c^2 = a^2 + b^2"
  quote: "Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving."
};
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- object methods (`.push()`, `delete`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

> 💡 The guidelines above are just suggestions. Feel free to include other concepts in your solution as you see fit. The implementation is up to you.

> 🤓 Happy learning! Open the playground and start coding!

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use the built-in methods to `delete` the `quote` and to add the new language.
