# Weekend & Weekday Switch

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to:
> - **create a switch statement with seven cases (for each day of the week)**
> - **each case can be represented as a number from 0-6 or a string**
> - **add a default case**
> - **each case should output something**

Example input output:
```javascript
// Input
2

// Output
// It is Wednesday my dudes!
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- flow control (`switch`)
- output (`console.log()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create a variable that will hold your input value. 

The `switch` statement should have a separate `case` for every day of the week.

Don't forget to `break` out of each case.
