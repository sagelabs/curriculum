    // 👋 Welcome to the JavaScript coding playground. 
    // You can use this array:

    let numbers = [23, 81, 14, 5, 33, 631, 47, 78, 99]

# Largest Array Element

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a loop that:
> - **cycles through an array**
> - **determines which number is the largest**
> - **outputs it to the console**

Example `array` to use:
```javascript
let numbers = [23, 81, 14, 5, 33, 631, 47, 78, 99]
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- looping (`for`)
- output (`console.log()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Assume that the first number is the largest then check if the next number is larger, if it is, update your initial number.
