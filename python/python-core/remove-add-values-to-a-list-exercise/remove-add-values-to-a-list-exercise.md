    # 👋 Welcome to the Python coding playground.

# Remove & Add Values to a List

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to:
> - **remove the last value from the smallerNumbers list**
> - **add the biggerNumbers list to the smaller one**
> - **output the new list**

Use these lists:
```python
smallerNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]
biggerNumbers = [7, 9, 11]
```


To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- built-in methods (`extend()`, `remove()`, `pop()`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

You have to pop a value from the smaller `list` and then add the bigger `list` to the smaller one using a built-in method.
