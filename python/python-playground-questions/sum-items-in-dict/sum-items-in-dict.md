## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that:
> - **takes a dictionary with at least five values as input**
> - **sums all of the values**
> - **outputs the result**

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 31`)
- function declaration (`def something(x):`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Add numbers to the dictionary.

Define a function that takes a dictionary as input.

The function should return the sum of the dictionaries values.

Finally, call the function with the previously created dictionary.
