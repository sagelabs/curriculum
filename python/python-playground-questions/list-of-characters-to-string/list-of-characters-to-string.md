# List of Character to a String

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to write a program that will:
> - **take a list of characters as input**
> - **transform it into a string**
> - **output the new string**

Example list:
```python
characters = [
	  'h', 
	  'e', 
	  'l', 
	  'l', 
	  'o', 
	  ' ', 
	  'w', 
	  'o', 
	  'r', 
	  'l', 
	  'd'
]
```

To achieve this, you can use the following concepts:
- function declaration (`def something(x):`)
- loops (`for...in...`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Create an empty string and use a `for...of` loop to go through every character of the list, concatenating each character to the empty string.
