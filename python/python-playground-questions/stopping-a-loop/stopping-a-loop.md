# Breaking a Loop

---

## Content

> 👩‍💻 Your task is to create a loop that:
> - **cycles through a list of names**
> - **outputs every name until it reaches a specific one, then break out of the loop**

Example list to use:

```python
scientists = [
  "Niels Bohr",
  "Galileo Galilei", 
  "Marie Curie", 
  "Albert Einstein", 
  "Rosalind Franklin", 
  "Katherine Johnson", 
  "Lise Meitner", 
  "Nikola Tesla"
  ]
```

To achieve this, you should use the following concepts:
- variable creation (`age = 29`)
- loops (`for x in y:...`)
- flow-altering statements (`break`, `continue`)

Learning is best when we give it an honest try. Even if we make a mistake, we'll remember it and do better next time.

That being said, if you're not sure how to get started, check out this footnote[1]. 

When you're finished, feel free to share your solution with the community, join in on discussions, and upvote solutions from your fellow learners!

Remember, learning is more effective when we do it with others.

## Footnotes

[1: Hints]

Use a loop to cycle through and `print` every name. 

When you reach the specified name, `break` out of the loop.
